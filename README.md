# 🛠️ Personal Tooling

<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

This is a monorepo for my personal tooling. It is built using [Nx](https://nx.dev) ✨.
⚠️ This is a work in progress. ⚠️

## 📓 TODO

- [ ] Add basic app to test out the tooling
- [ ] Add a release action to publish the packages to npm
- [ ] I don't know what else yet 🤷‍♂️

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.

## Further help

Visit the [Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev) to learn more.
